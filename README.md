The data summary provides us with the metadata for the data. Herein, few observations found includes:

- Litho-logs comprise features {Spectral Gamma, GR, SP, Mud-log, Caliper}
- Porosity	comprises features {DT,	RHOB, CNL}
- RES	comprises features {LLD, LLS}
- Biostratigraphic Data
- Well-Tops/Formation Tops
- Reports	comprises features {Geologic,	Rock-Eval}
- Rock-Eval	comprises features {S1, S2, S3,	HI,	OI, VR,	TOC, Tmax}

These features were collected mostly for Kolmani river 2(KR2) and Kolmani river 3(KR3). To have a fair analysis, we will only include features that are available in both KR2 & KR3.

PS. Most of the Multivariate linear regression analysis was repeated to confirm the dependent variable, what was discovered was that, the TOC(measured) was the actual variable predicted across all analysis
